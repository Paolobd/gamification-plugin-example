# Game GUI Library Example
This project has been created as a demonstration of how to import and implement the [Game GUI Java Library](https://github.com/Paolobd/gamification-library). 

The [Game GUI IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/Paolobd/intellij-gamification-plugin) must be installed in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE to be able to test the created gamified environment.  
To utilize it, simply install the plugin and run the Selenium WebDriver tests.

These tools have been developed as a **Master Thesis** work by Paolo Stefanut Bodnarescul at _Politecnico di Torino_ with the aid of the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://softeng.polito.it/).
